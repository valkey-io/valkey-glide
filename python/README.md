## Installation and Setup

### Installing via Package Manager (pip)

To install Valkey GLIDE using `pip`, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Execute the command below:
    ```bash
    $ pip install valkey-glide
    ```
3. After installation, confirm the client is accessible by running:
    ```bash
    $ python3
    >>> import glide
    ```

## Basic Examples

#### Cluster Mode:

```python:
>>> import asyncio
>>> from glide import GlideClusterClientConfiguration, NodeAddress, GlideClusterClient
>>> async def test_cluster_client():
...     addresses = [NodeAddress("address.example.com", 6379)]
...     config = GlideClusterClientConfiguration(addresses)
...     client = await GlideClusterClient.create(config)
...     set_result = await client.set("foo", "bar")
...     print(f"Set response is {set_result}")
...     get_result = await client.get("foo")
...     print(f"Get response is {get_result}")
... 
>>> asyncio.run(test_cluster_client())
Set response is OK
Get response is bar
```

#### Standalone Mode:

```python:
>>> import asyncio
>>> from glide import GlideClientConfiguration, NodeAddress, GlideClient
>>> async def test_standalone_client():
...     addresses = [
...             NodeAddress("server_primary.example.com", 6379),
...             NodeAddress("server_replica.example.com", 6379)
...     ]
...     config = GlideClientConfiguration(addresses)
...     client = await GlideClient.create(config)
...     set_result = await client.set("foo", "bar")
...     print(f"Set response is {set_result}")
...     get_result = await client.get("foo")
...     print(f"Get response is {get_result}")
... 
>>> asyncio.run(test_standalone_client())
Set response is OK
Get response is bar
```
