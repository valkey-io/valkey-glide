## Basic Examples

### üîÅ Async Client

### ‚úÖ Async Cluster Mode

```python
import asyncio
from glide import GlideClusterClientConfiguration, NodeAddress, GlideClusterClient

async def test_cluster_client():
    addresses = [NodeAddress("address.example.com", 6379)]
    # It is recommended to set a timeout for your specific use case
    config = GlideClusterClientConfiguration(addresses, request_timeout=500)  # 500ms timeout
    client = await GlideClusterClient.create(config)
    set_result = await client.set("foo", "bar")
    print(f"Set response is {set_result}")
    get_result = await client.get("foo")
    print(f"Get response is {get_result}")

asyncio.run(test_cluster_client())
```

#### ‚úÖ Async Standalone Mode

```python
import asyncio
from glide import GlideClientConfiguration, NodeAddress, GlideClient

async def test_standalone_client():
    addresses = [
        NodeAddress("server_primary.example.com", 6379),
        NodeAddress("server_replica.example.com", 6379)
    ]
    # It is recommended to set a timeout for your specific use case
    config = GlideClientConfiguration(addresses, request_timeout=500)  # 500ms timeout
    client = await GlideClient.create(config)
    set_result = await client.set("foo", "bar")
    print(f"Set response is {set_result}")
    get_result = await client.get("foo")
    print(f"Get response is {get_result}")

asyncio.run(test_standalone_client())
```

### üîÇ Sync Client

#### ‚úÖ Sync Cluster Mode

```python
from glide_sync import GlideClusterClientConfiguration, NodeAddress, GlideClusterClient

def test_cluster_client():
    addresses = [NodeAddress("address.example.com", 6379)]
    # It is recommended to set a timeout for your specific use case
    config = GlideClusterClientConfiguration(addresses, request_timeout=500)  # 500ms timeout
    client = GlideClusterClient.create(config)
    set_result = client.set("foo", "bar")
    print(f"Set response is {set_result}")
    get_result = client.get("foo")
    print(f"Get response is {get_result}")

test_cluster_client()
```

#### ‚úÖ Sync Standalone Mode

```python
from glide_sync import GlideClientConfiguration, NodeAddress, GlideClient

def test_standalone_client():
    addresses = [
        NodeAddress("server_primary.example.com", 6379),
        NodeAddress("server_replica.example.com", 6379)
    ]
    # It is recommended to set a timeout for your specific use case
    config = GlideClientConfiguration(addresses, request_timeout=500)  # 500ms timeout
    client = GlideClient.create(config)
    set_result = client.set("foo", "bar")
    print(f"Set response is {set_result}")
    get_result = client.get("foo")
    print(f"Get response is {get_result}")

test_standalone_client()
```
