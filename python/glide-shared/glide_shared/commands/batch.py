                E.g., if `get_pattern` is `name_*`, the command will return the values of the keys `name_<element>`

class ClusterBatch(BaseBatch):
    """
    Batch implementation for cluster GlideClusterClient. Batches allow the execution of a group
    of commands in a single step.

    Batch Response:
        An ``array`` of command responses is returned by the client ``exec`` command,
        in the order they were given. Each element in the array represents a command given to the ClusterBatch.
        The response for each command depends on the executed Valkey command.
        Specific response types are documented alongside each method.

    Args:
        is_atomic (bool): Determines whether the batch is atomic or non-atomic. If ``True``,
            the batch will be executed as an atomic transaction. If ``False``,
            the batch will be executed as a non-atomic pipeline.

    See [Valkey Transactions (Atomic Batches)](https://valkey.io/topics/transactions/) and [Valkey Pipelines (Non-Atomic Batches)](https://valkey.io/topics/pipelining/) for details.

    Examples:
        ### Atomic Batch - Transaction in a Cluster:
        >>> transaction = ClusterBatch(is_atomic=True)  # Atomic (Transaction)
        >>> transaction.set("key", "value")

        ### Non-Atomic Batch - Pipeline in a Cluster:
        >>> pipeline = ClusterBatch(is_atomic=False)  # Non-Atomic (Pipeline)
        >>> pipeline.set("key1", "value1")
        >>> pipeline.set("key2", "value2")
