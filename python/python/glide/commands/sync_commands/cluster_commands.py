            For example - Return a list of all pub/sub clients from all nodes::

                connection.customCommand(["CLIENT", "LIST","TYPE", "PUBSUB"], AllNodes())

        Args:
            command_args (List[TEncodable]): List of the command's arguments, where each argument is either a string or bytes.
            Every part of the command, including the command name and subcommands, should be added as a separate value in args.
            route (Optional[Route]): The command will be routed automatically based on the passed command's default request
                policy, unless `route` is provided, in which
            case the client will route the command to the nodes defined by `route`. Defaults to None.

            TClusterResponse[TResult]: The returning value depends on the executed command and the route.

                information to retrieve. When no parameter is provided, the default option is assumed.
            route (Optional[Route]): The command will be routed to all primaries, unless `route` is provided, in which
                case the client will route the command to the nodes defined by `route`. Defaults to None.

        Returns:
            TClusterResponse[bytes]: If a single node route is requested, returns a bytes string containing the information for
            the required sections. Otherwise, returns a dict of bytes strings, with each key containing the address of
            the queried node and value containing the information regarding the requested sections.
