⚠️ OpenTelemetry can only be initialized once per process. Calling `OpenTelemetry.init()` more than once will be ignored.
If you need to change configuration, restart the process with new settings.

### OpenTelemetry

- **openTelemetryConfig**: Use this object to configure OpenTelemetry exporters and options.
  - **traces**: (optional) Configure trace exporting.
    - **endpoint**: The collector endpoint for traces. Supported protocols:
      - `http://` or `https://` for HTTP/HTTPS
      - `grpc://` for gRPC
      - `file://` for local file export (see below)
    - **sample_percentage**: (optional) The percentage of requests to sample and create a span for, used to measure command duration. Must be between 0 and 100. Defaults to 1 if not specified.
      Note: There is a tradeoff between sampling percentage and performance. Higher sampling percentages will provide more detailed telemetry data but will impact performance.
      It is recommended to keep this number low (1-5%) in production environments unless you have specific needs for higher sampling rates.
  - **metrics**: (optional) Configure metrics exporting.
    - **endpoint**: The collector endpoint for metrics. Same protocol rules as above.
  - **flush_interval_ms**: (optional) Interval in milliseconds for flushing data to the collector. Must be a positive integer. Defaults to 5000ms if not specified.

#### File Exporter Details
- For `file://` endpoints:
  - The path must start with `file://` (e.g., `file:///tmp/otel` or `file:///tmp/otel/traces.json`).
  - If the path is a directory or lacks a file extension, data is written to `signals.json` in that directory.
  - If the path includes a filename with an extension, that file is used as-is.
  - The parent directory must already exist; otherwise, initialization will fail with an InvalidInput error.
  - If the target file exists, new data is appended (not overwritten).

#### Validation Rules
- `flush_interval_ms` must be a positive integer.
- `sample_percentage` must be between 0 and 100.
- File exporter paths must start with `file://` and have an existing parent directory.
- Invalid configuration will throw an error synchronously when calling `OpenTelemetry.init()`.

    Singleton class for managing OpenTelemetry configuration and operations.

    This class provides a centralized way to initialize OpenTelemetry and control
    sampling behavior at runtime.

    Example usage:
        ```python
        from glide import OpenTelemetry, OpenTelemetryConfig, OpenTelemetryTracesConfig, OpenTelemetryMetricsConfig

        OpenTelemetry.init(OpenTelemetryConfig(
            traces=OpenTelemetryTracesConfig(

                sample_percentage=10  # Optional, defaults to 1. Can also be changed at runtime via set_sample_percentage().
            ),

        OpenTelemetry can only be initialized once per process. Subsequent calls to
        init() will be ignored. This is by design, as OpenTelemetry is a global
        resource that should be configured once at application startup.
