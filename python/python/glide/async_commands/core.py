        Note: When in cluster mode, `key`, and any patterns specified in `by_pattern` or `get_patterns`

            by_pattern (Optional[TEncodable]): A pattern to sort by external keys instead of by the elements stored at the key themselves.
                The pattern should contain an asterisk (*) as a placeholder for the element values, where the value
                from the key replaces the asterisk to create the key name. For example, if `key` contains IDs of objects,
                `by_pattern` can be used to sort these IDs based on an attribute of the objects, like their weights or
                timestamps.

                keys `weight_<element>`.
                If not provided, elements are sorted by their value.
                Supported in cluster mode since Valkey version 8.0.
            limit (Optional[Limit]): Limiting the range of the query by setting offset and result count. See `Limit` class for more information.
            get_patterns (Optional[List[TEncodable]]): A pattern used to retrieve external keys' values, instead of the elements at `key`.
                The pattern should contain an asterisk (*) as a placeholder for the element values, where the value
                from `key` replaces the asterisk to create the key name. This allows the sorted elements to be
                transformed based on the related keys values. For example, if `key` contains IDs of users, `get_pattern`
                can be used to retrieve specific attributes of these users, such as their names or email addresses.

                Can be `OrderBy.ASC` (ascending) or `OrderBy.DESC` (descending).
            alpha (Optional[bool]): When `True`, sorts elements lexicographically. When `False` (default), sorts elements numerically.

                The pattern should contain an asterisk (*) as a placeholder for the element values, where the value
