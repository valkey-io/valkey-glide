        To get the sort result without storing it into a key, see `sort`.

            by_pattern (Optional[TEncodable]): A pattern to sort by external keys instead of by the elements stored at the key themselves.
                The pattern should contain an asterisk (*) as a placeholder for the element values, where the value
