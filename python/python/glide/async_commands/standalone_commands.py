        Sorts the elements in the list, set, or sorted set at `key` and returns the result.

        This command is routed to primary nodes only.
        To store the result into a new key, see `sort_store`.

        See https://valkey.io/commands/sort for more details.

        Args:
            key (TEncodable): The key of the list, set, or sorted set to be sorted.
            by_pattern (Optional[TEncodable]): A pattern to sort by external keys instead of by the elements stored at the key themselves.
                The pattern should contain an asterisk (*) as a placeholder for the element values, where the value
                from the key replaces the asterisk to create the key name. For example, if `key` contains IDs of objects,
                `by_pattern` can be used to sort these IDs based on an attribute of the objects, like their weights or
                timestamps.
                E.g., if `by_pattern` is `weight_*`, the command will sort the elements by the values of the
                keys `weight_<element>`.
                If not provided, elements are sorted by their value.
            limit (Optional[Limit]): Limiting the range of the query by setting offset and result count. See `Limit` class for more information.
            get_patterns (Optional[List[TEncodable]]): A pattern used to retrieve external keys' values, instead of the elements at `key`.
                The pattern should contain an asterisk (*) as a placeholder for the element values, where the value
                from `key` replaces the asterisk to create the key name. This allows the sorted elements to be
                transformed based on the related keys values. For example, if `key` contains IDs of users, `get_pattern`
                can be used to retrieve specific attributes of these users, such as their names or email addresses.
                E.g., if `get_pattern` is `name_*`, the command will return the values of the keys `name_<element>`
                for each sorted element. Multiple `get_pattern` arguments can be provided to retrieve multiple attributes.
                The special value `#` can be used to include the actual element from `key` being sorted.
                If not provided, only the sorted elements themselves are returned.
            order (Optional[OrderBy]): Specifies the order to sort the elements.
                Can be `OrderBy.ASC` (ascending) or `OrderBy.DESC` (descending).
            alpha (Optional[bool]): When `True`, sorts elements lexicographically. When `False` (default), sorts elements numerically.
                Use this when the list, set, or sorted set contains string values that cannot be converted into double precision floating point

            List[Optional[bytes]]: Returns a list of sorted elements.

        Incrementally iterate over a collection of keys.
        SCAN is a cursor based iterator. This means that at every call of the command,
        the server returns an updated cursor that the user needs to use as the cursor argument in the next call.
        An iteration starts when the cursor is set to "0", and terminates when the cursor returned by the server is "0".

        A full iteration always retrieves all the elements that were present
        in the collection from the start to the end of a full iteration.
        Elements that were not constantly present in the collection during a full iteration, may be returned or not.

        See https://valkey.io/commands/scan for more details.

        Args:
            cursor (TResult): The cursor used for iteration. For the first iteration, the cursor should be set to "0".
              Using a non-zero cursor in the first iteration,
              or an invalid cursor at any iteration, will lead to undefined results.
              Using the same cursor in multiple iterations will, in case nothing changed between the iterations,
                return the same elements multiple times.
                If the the db has changed, it may result an undefined behavior.
            match (Optional[TResult]): A pattern to match keys against.
            count (Optional[int]): The number of keys to return per iteration.
                The number of keys returned per iteration is not guaranteed to be the same as the count argument.
                the argument is used as a hint for the server to know how many "steps" it can use to retrieve the keys.
                The default value is 10.
            type (ObjectType): The type of object to scan for.

        Returns:
            List[Union[bytes, List[bytes]]]: A List containing the next cursor value and a list of keys,
                formatted as [cursor, [key1, key2, ...]]
