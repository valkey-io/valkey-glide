class Limit:
    """
    Represents a limit argument for range queries in various commands.

    The `LIMIT` argument is commonly used to specify a subset of results from the matching elements,
    similar to the `LIMIT` clause in SQL (e.g., `SELECT LIMIT offset, count`).

    This class can be utilized in multiple commands that support limit options,
    such as [ZRANGE](https://valkey.io/commands/zrange), [SORT](https://valkey.io/commands/sort/), and others.

    Args:
        offset (int): The starting position of the range, zero based.
        count (int): The maximum number of elements to include in the range.
            A negative count returns all elements from the offset.

    Examples:
        >>> limit = Limit(0, 10)  # Fetch the first 10 elements
        >>> limit = Limit(5, -1)  # Fetch all elements starting from the 5th element
