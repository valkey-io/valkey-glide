        Incrementally iterates over the keys in the Cluster.
        The method returns a list containing the next cursor and a list of keys.

        This command is similar to the SCAN command, but it is designed to work in a Cluster environment.
        For each iteration the new cursor object should be used to continue the scan.
        Using the same cursor object for multiple iterations will result in the same keys or unexpected behavior.
        For more information about the Cluster Scan implementation,
        see [Cluster Scan](https://github.com/aws/glide-for-redis/wiki/General-Concepts#cluster-scan).

        As the SCAN command, the method can be used to iterate over the keys in the database,
        to return all keys the database have from the time the scan started till the scan ends.
        The same key can be returned in multiple scans iteration.

        See https://valkey.io/commands/scan/ for more details.

        Args:
            cursor (ClusterScanCursor): The cursor object that wraps the scan state.
              To start a new scan, create a new empty ClusterScanCursor using ClusterScanCursor().
            match (Optional[TEncodable]): A pattern to match keys against.
            count (Optional[int]): The number of keys to return in a single iteration.
              The actual number returned can vary and is not guaranteed to match this count exactly.
              This parameter serves as a hint to the server on the number of steps to perform in each iteration.
              The default value is 10.
            type (Optional[ObjectType]): The type of object to scan for.

        Returns:
            List[Union[ClusterScanCursor, List[TEncodable]]]: A list containing the next cursor and a list of keys,
              formatted as [ClusterScanCursor, [key1, key2, ...]].
