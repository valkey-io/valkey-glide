        The method returns a list containing the next cursor and a list of keys.

        This command is similar to the SCAN command, but it is designed to work in a Cluster environment.
        For each iteration the new cursor object should be used to continue the scan.
        Using the same cursor object for multiple iterations will result in the same keys or unexpected behavior.
        For more information about the Cluster Scan implementation,
        see [Cluster Scan](https://github.com/aws/glide-for-redis/wiki/General-Concepts#cluster-scan).

        As the SCAN command, the method can be used to iterate over the keys in the database,
        to return all keys the database have from the time the scan started till the scan ends.
        The same key can be returned in multiple scans iteration.

        See https://valkey.io/commands/scan/ for more details.
