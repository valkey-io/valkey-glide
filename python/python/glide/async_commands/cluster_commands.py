        Sorts the elements in the list, set, or sorted set at `key` and returns the result.
        To store the result into a new key, see `sort_store`.

        By default, sorting is numeric, and elements are compared by their value interpreted as double precision floating point numbers.

        See https://valkey.io/commands/sort for more details.

        Args:
            key (str): The key of the list, set, or sorted set to be sorted.
            limit (Optional[Limit]): Limiting the range of the query by setting offset and result count. See `Limit` class for more information.
            order (Optional[OrderBy]): Specifies the order to sort the elements.
                Can be `OrderBy.ASC` (ascending) or `OrderBy.DESC` (descending).
            alpha (Optional[bool]): When `True`, sorts elements lexicographically. When `False` (default), sorts elements numerically.
                Use this when the list, set, or sorted set contains string values that cannot be converted into double precision floating point numbers.

        Returns:
            List[str]: A list of sorted elements.

        Examples:
            >>> await client.lpush("mylist", '3', '1', '2')
