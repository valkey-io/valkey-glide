    A singleton class that allows logging which is consistent with logs from the internal rust core.
    The logger can be set up in 2 ways -
    1. By calling Logger.init, which configures the logger only if it wasn't previously configured.
    2. By calling Logger.set_logger_config, which replaces the existing configuration, and means that new logs will not be
        saved with the logs that were sent before the call.
    If set_logger_config wasn't called, the first log attempt will initialize a new logger with default configuration decided
    by the Rust core.
