    A singleton class that allows logging which is consistent with logs from the internal GLIDE core.
    The logger can be set up in 2 ways -
    1. By calling Logger.init, which configures the logger only if it wasn't previously configured.
    2. By calling Logger.set_logger_config, which replaces the existing configuration, and means that new logs will not be
    saved with the logs that were sent before the call.
    If none of these functions are called, the first log attempt will initialize a new logger with default configuration.
