        Update the current connection password with a new password.

        Note:
            This method updates the client's internal password configuration and does
            not perform password rotation on the server side.

        This method is useful in scenarios where the server password has changed or when
        utilizing short-lived passwords for enhanced security. It allows the client to
        update its password to reconnect upon disconnection without the need to recreate
        the client instance. This ensures that the internal reconnection mechanism can
        handle reconnection seamlessly, preventing the loss of in-flight commands.

        Args:
            password (`Optional[str]`): The new password to use for the connection,
                if `None` the password will be removed.
            immediate_auth (`bool`):
                `True`: The client will authenticate immediately with the new password against all connections, Using `AUTH`
                command. If password supplied is an empty string, auth will not be performed and warning will be returned.
                The default is `False`.

        Returns:
            TOK: A simple OK response. If `immediate_auth=True` returns OK if the reauthenticate succeed.

        Example:
            >>> await client.update_connection_password("new_password", immediate_auth=True)
            'OK'

                to return only a subset of the sorted set then there could be a case where the result is empty although there

        Returns the indices and length of the longest common subsequence between strings stored at key1 and key2.

        Note:
            This is different than the longest common string algorithm, since
            matching characters in the two strings do not need to be contiguous.

            For instance the LCS between "foo" and "fao" is "fo", since scanning the two strings
            from left to right, the longest common set of characters is composed of the first "f" and then the "o".

        See [valkey.io](https://valkey.io/commands/lcs) for more details.

        Args:
            key1 (TEncodable): The key that stores the first string value.
            key2 (TEncodable): The key that stores the second string value.
            min_match_len (Optional[int]): The minimum length of matches to include in the result.
            with_match_len (Optional[bool]): If True, include the length of the substring matched for each substring.

        Returns:
            A Mapping containing the indices of the longest common subsequence between the
            2 strings and the length of the longest common subsequence. The resulting map contains two
            keys, "matches" and "len":

                - "len" is mapped to the length of the longest common subsequence between the 2 strings.
                - "matches" is mapped to a three dimensional int array that stores pairs of indices that
                  represent the location of the common subsequences in the strings held by key1 and key2,
                  with the length of the match after each matches, if with_match_len is enabled.

            alpha (Optional[bool]): When `True`, sorts elements lexicographically. When `False` (default), sorts elements

        Sorts the elements in the list, set, or sorted set at `key` and stores the result in `store`.
        The `sort` command can be used to sort elements based on different criteria, apply transformations on sorted elements,
        and store the result in a new key.
        To get the sort result without storing it into a key, see `sort`.

        See [valkey.io](https://valkey.io/commands/sort) for more details.

        Note:
            When in cluster mode, `key`, `destination`, and any patterns specified in `by_pattern` or `get_patterns`
            must map to the same hash slot. The use of `by_pattern` and `get_patterns` in cluster mode is supported
            only since Valkey version 8.0.

        Args:
            key (TEncodable): The key of the list, set, or sorted set to be sorted.
            destination (TEncodable): The key where the sorted result will be stored.
            by_pattern (Optional[TEncodable]): A pattern to sort by external keys instead of by the elements stored at the key
                themselves.
                The pattern should contain an asterisk (*) as a placeholder for the element values, where the value
                from the key replaces the asterisk to create the key name. For example, if `key` contains IDs of objects,
                `by_pattern` can be used to sort these IDs based on an attribute of the objects, like their weights or
                timestamps.
                E.g., if `by_pattern` is `weight_*`, the command will sort the elements by the values of the
                keys `weight_<element>`.
                If not provided, elements are sorted by their value.
                Supported in cluster mode since Valkey version 8.0.
            limit (Optional[Limit]): Limiting the range of the query by setting offset and result count. See `Limit` class for
                more information.
            get_patterns (Optional[List[TEncodable]]): A pattern used to retrieve external keys' values, instead of the
                elements at `key`.
                The pattern should contain an asterisk (*) as a placeholder for the element values, where the value
                from `key` replaces the asterisk to create the key name. This allows the sorted elements to be
                transformed based on the related keys values. For example, if `key` contains IDs of users, `get_pattern`
                can be used to retrieve specific attributes of these users, such as their names or email addresses.
                E.g., if `get_pattern` is `name_*`, the command will return the values of the keys `name_<element>`
                for each sorted element. Multiple `get_pattern` arguments can be provided to retrieve multiple attributes.
                The special value `#` can be used to include the actual element from `key` being sorted.
                If not provided, only the sorted elements themselves are returned.
                Supported in cluster mode since Valkey version 8.0.
            order (Optional[OrderBy]): Specifies the order to sort the elements.
                Can be `OrderBy.ASC` (ascending) or `OrderBy.DESC` (descending).
            alpha (Optional[bool]): When `True`, sorts elements lexicographically. When `False` (default), sorts elements
                numerically.
                Use this when the list, set, or sorted set contains string values that cannot be converted into double
                precision floating point

        Returns:
            int: The number of elements in the sorted key stored at `store`.

        Examples:
            >>> await client.lpush("mylist", ['3', '1', '2'])
            >>> await client.sort_store("mylist", "{mylist}sorted_list")
                3  # Indicates that the sorted list "{mylist}sorted_list" contains three elements.
            >>> await client.lrange("{mylist}sorted_list", 0, -1)
                [b'1', b'2', b'3']
