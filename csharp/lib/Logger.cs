    A class that allows logging which is consistent with logs from the internal rust core.
    Only one instance of this class can exist at any given time. The logger can be set up in 2 ways -
        1. By calling init, which creates and modifies a new logger only if one doesn't exist.
        2. By calling setConfig, which replaces the existing logger, and means that new logs will not be saved with the logs that were sent before the call.
    If no call to any of these function is received, the first log attempt will initialize a new logger with default level decided by rust core (normally - console, error).
