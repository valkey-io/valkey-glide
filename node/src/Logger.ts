/*
A singleton class that allows logging which is consistent with logs from the internal rust core.
The logger can be set up in 2 ways -
    1. By calling init, which configures the logger only if it wasn't previously configured.
    2. By calling Logger.setLoggerConfig, which replaces the existing configuration, and means that new logs will not be saved with the logs that were sent before the call. The previous logs will remain unchanged.
If no call to any of these function is received, the first log attempt will configure the logger with default configuration decided by rust core.
