     * - **TLS**: If `useTLS` is set to `true`, the client will establish secure connections using TLS.
     *      Should match the TLS configuration of the server/cluster, otherwise the connection attempt will fail.
     *      For advanced tls configuration, please use the {@link AdvancedGlideClusterClientConfiguration} option.
     * - **Periodic Checks**: The `periodicChecks` setting allows you to configure how often the client checks for cluster topology changes.

    /**
     * Incrementally iterates over the keys in the Cluster.
     *
     * This command is similar to the `SCAN` command but designed for Cluster environments.
     * It uses a {@link ClusterScanCursor} object to manage iterations.
     *
     * For each iteration, use the new cursor object to continue the scan.
     * Using the same cursor object for multiple iterations may result in unexpected behavior.
     *
     * For more information about the Cluster Scan implementation, see
     * {@link https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/General-Concepts#cluster-scan | Cluster Scan}.
     *
     * This method can iterate over all keys in the database from the start of the scan until it ends.
     * The same key may be returned in multiple scan iterations.
     * The API does not accept `route` as it go through all slots in the cluster.
     *

    /**
     * Executes a batch by processing the queued commands.
     *
     * **Routing Behavior:**
     *
     * - If a `route` is specified in {@link ClusterBatchOptions}, the entire batch is sent to the specified node.
     * - If no `route` is specified:
     *   - **Atomic batches (Transactions):** Routed to the slot owner of the first key in the batch. If no key is found, the request is sent to a random node.
     *   - **Non-atomic batches (Pipelines):** Each command is routed to the node owning the corresponding key's slot. If no key is present, routing follows the command's request policy. Multi-node commands are automatically split and dispatched to the appropriate nodes.
     *
     * **Behavior Notes:**
     *
     * - **Atomic Batches (Transactions):** All key-based commands must map to the same hash slot. If keys span different slots, the transaction will fail. If the transaction fails due to a `WATCH` command, `exec` will return `null`.
     *
     * @see {@link https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/NodeJS-wrapper#transaction|Valkey Glide Wiki} for details on Valkey Transactions.
     *

     *
     * - If a redirection error occurs:
     *   - **Atomic batches (Transactions):** The entire transaction will be redirected.
     *   - **Non-atomic batches (Pipelines):** Only commands that encountered redirection errors will be retried.
     * - Retries for failures will be handled according to the configured {@link BatchRetryStrategy}.
     *
     * @param batch - A {@link ClusterBatch} containing the commands to execute.
     * @param raiseOnError - Determines how errors are handled within the batch response.
     *   - If `true`, the first encountered error in the batch will be raised as an exception of type {@link RequestError}
     *     after all retries and reconnections have been exhausted.
     *   - If `false`, errors will be included as part of the batch response, allowing the caller to process both successful and failed commands together.
     *     In this case, error details will be provided as instances of {@link RequestError} in the response list.
     * @param options - (Optional) {@link ClusterBatchOptions} and {@link DecoderOption} specifying execution and decoding behavior.
     * @returns A Promise resolving to an array of results, where each entry corresponds to a command’s execution result.
     *   - If the transaction fails due to a `WATCH` command, the promise resolves to `null`.
