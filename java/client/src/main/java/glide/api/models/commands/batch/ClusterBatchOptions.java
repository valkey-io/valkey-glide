     *   <li>If {@code retryServerError} is {@code true}, retriable errors (e.g., TRYAGAIN) will

     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Retrying server errors may cause commands targeting the same slot to execute out of
     *       order.
     *   <li>Retrying connection errors may lead to duplicate executions, as it is unclear which
     *       commands have already been processed.

     * options.</b>

     *
     * <p><b>Recommendation:</b> It is recommended to increase the timeout in {@code BaseBatchOptions}
     * when enabling these strategies.
