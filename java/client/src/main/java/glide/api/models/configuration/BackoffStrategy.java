/**
 * Represents the strategy used to determine how and when to reconnect, in case of connection
 * failures. The time between attempts grows exponentially, following the formula <code>
 * rand(0 ... factor *
 * (exponentBase ^ N))</code>, where <code>N</code> is the number of failed attempts, and <code>
 * rand(...)</code> applies a jitter of up to <code>jitterPercent</code>% to introduce randomness
 * and reduce retry storms.
 *
 * <p>Once the maximum value is reached, that will remain the time between retry attempts until a
 * reconnect attempt is successful. The client will attempt to reconnect indefinitely.
 *
 * @example
 *     <pre>{@code
 * BackoffStrategy reconnectionConfiguration = BackoffStrategy.builder()
 *     .numOfRetries(5)
 *     .exponentBase(2)
 *     .factor(3)
 *     .jitterPercent(20)
 *     .build()
 * }</pre>
