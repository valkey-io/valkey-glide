### Valkey GLIDE

Valkey General Language Independent Driver for the Enterprise (GLIDE), is an AWS-sponsored, open-source Valkey client that includes support for open-source Redis 6.2 to 7.2. Valkey GLIDE works with any distribution that adheres to the Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP) specification, including Amazon ElastiCache, and Amazon MemoryDB.
Strategic, mission-critical applications have requirements for security, optimized performance, minimal downtime, and observability. Valkey GLIDE is designed to provide a client experience that helps meet these objectives. It is sponsored and supported by AWS, and comes pre-configured with best practices learned from over a decade of operating RESP-compatible services used by hundreds of thousands of customers. To help ensure consistency in development and operations, Valkey GLIDE is implemented using a core driver framework, written in Rust, with extensions made available for each supported programming language. This design ensures that updates easily propagate to each language and reduces overall complexity. In this Preview release, Valkey GLIDE is available for Python and Java, with support for Javascript (Node.js) actively under development.

## Supported Engine Versions
GLIDE for Redis is API-compatible with the following engine versions:

| Engine Type        | Version |
|--------------------|---------|
| Valkey and Redis   | 7.2     |
| Valkey and Redis   | 7.0     |
| Valkey and Redis   | 6.2     |

## Current Status
We've made GLIDE for Redis an open-source project, and are releasing it in Preview to the community to gather feedback, and actively collaborate on the project roadmap. We welcome questions and contributions from all Redis stakeholders.
This preview release is recommended for testing purposes only. It is available in Python and Javascript (Node.js), with Java to follow. We're tracking its production readiness and future features on the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/aws/projects/187/).
