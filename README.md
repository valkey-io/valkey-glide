## Key Features
- **[AZ Affinity](https://valkey.io/blog/az-affinity-strategy/)** – Ensures low-latency connections and minimal cross-zone costs by routing read traffic to replicas in the clients availability zone. **(Requires Valkey server version 8.0+ or AWS ElastiCache for Valkey 7.2+)**.
- **[PubSub Auto-Reconnection](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/General-Concepts#pubsub-support:~:text=PubSub%20Support,Receiving%2C%20and%20Unsubscribing.)** – Seamless background resubscription on topology updates or disconnection.
- **[Sharded PubSub](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/General-Concepts#pubsub-support:~:text=Receiving%2C%20and%20Unsubscribing.-,Subscribing,routed%20to%20the%20server%20holding%20the%20slot%20for%20the%20command%27s%20channel.,-Receiving)** – Native support for sharded PubSub across cluster slots.
- **[Cluster-Aware MGET/MSET/DEL/FLUSHALL](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/General-Concepts#multi-slot-command-handling:~:text=Multi%2DSlot%20Command%20Execution,JSON.MGET)** – Execute multi-key commands across cluster slots without manual key grouping.
- **[Cluster Scan](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/General-Concepts#cluster-scan)** – Unified key iteration across shards using a consistent, high-level API for cluster environments.
- **Support for TS / CJS / MJS** – Fully compatible with modern and legacy JavaScript/TypeScript runtimes.
- **Support for asyncio / anyio / trio** – Native compatibility with modern Python async frameworks, enabling efficient and seamless integration into asynchronous workflows.
- **[Batching (Pipeline and Transaction)](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/General-Concepts#batching-pipeline-and-transaction)** – Efficiently execute multiple commands in a single network roundtrip, significantly reducing latency and improving throughput.
- **[OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/General-Concepts#opentelemetry)** – Integrated tracing support for enhanced observability and easier debugging in distributed environments.
