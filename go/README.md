## Basic Examples


### Standalone Example:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"

    glide "github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/go/v2"
    "github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/go/v2/config"
)

func main() {
    host := "localhost"
    port := 6379

    config := config.NewClientConfiguration().
        WithAddress(&config.NodeAddress{Host: host, Port: port})

    client, err := glide.NewClient(config)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("There was an error: ", err)
        return
    }

    res, err := client.Ping(context.Background())
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("There was an error: ", err)

        fmt.Println("There was an error: ", err)
        return
    }

    res, err := client.Ping(context.Background())
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("There was an error: ", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println(res) // PONG

    client.Close()
}
```

### Building & Testing

Development instructions for local building & testing the package are in the [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md) file.

## Cross-Compilation Guide

### Cross-Compiling with Docker

Valkey GLIDE uses CGO to interface with its Rust-based core, shipped as pre-built static libraries for each target platform, which can make cross-compilation challenging. Docker provides a convenient solution for cross-compiling applications that use Valkey GLIDE.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system
- Your Go application using Valkey GLIDE

#### Cross-Compiling for Linux (AMD64/ARM64)

The official Golang Docker image includes the necessary tools for cross-compiling to Linux targets:

```bash
# Build for Linux AMD64
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app golang:1.22 \
  bash -c "CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp-linux-amd64 ./..."

# Build for Linux ARM64
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app golang:1.22 \
  bash -c "CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 CC=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc go build -o myapp-linux-arm64 ./..."
```

#### Cross-Compiling for macOS

Due to Apple's platform restrictions, cross-compiling CGO code for macOS requires building on a macOS system:

```bash
# On a macOS system
CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp-darwin-amd64 ./...
CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o myapp-darwin-arm64 ./...
```

### Setting Up GitHub Actions for Multi-Platform Builds

You can use GitHub Actions to automatically build your application for all supported platforms. Here's a sample workflow file:

```yaml
name: Multi-Platform Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build ${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.arch }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.runner }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
          - os: linux
            arch: amd64
            runner: ubuntu-latest
          - os: linux
            arch: arm64
            runner: ubuntu-latest
          - os: darwin
            arch: amd64
            runner: macos-latest
          - os: darwin
            arch: arm64
            runner: macos-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      with:
        go-version: '1.22'

    - name: Build Linux
      if: matrix.os == 'linux'
      run: |
        if [ "${{ matrix.arch }}" = "amd64" ]; then
          CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp-linux-amd64 ./...
        else
          CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 CC=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc go build -o myapp-linux-arm64 ./...
        fi

    - name: Build macOS
      if: matrix.os == 'darwin'
      run: |
        CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=darwin GOARCH=${{ matrix.arch }} go build -o myapp-darwin-${{ matrix.arch }} ./...

    - name: Upload artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: myapp-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.arch }}
        path: myapp-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.arch }}
```

This workflow:

1. Runs on both push to main and pull requests
2. Creates a build matrix for all four supported platforms
3. Uses the appropriate runner for each OS
4. Sets the correct build flags for each platform
5. Uploads the compiled binaries as artifacts

You can customize this workflow to fit your specific application needs, such as adding tests, packaging steps, or deployment actions.

### Troubleshooting Cross-Compilation

If you encounter issues during cross-compilation:

1. **Missing Libraries**: Ensure Valkey GLIDE is properly installed and its pre-compiled libraries are available
2. **Linker Errors**: Check that CGO is enabled and the correct cross-compiler is being used
3. **Architecture Mismatch**: Verify that you're using the correct GOARCH value for your target platform
4. **Docker Issues**: Make sure your Docker container has sufficient resources and access to the source code

For more complex cross-compilation scenarios or if you encounter specific issues, please open a GitHub issue for assistance.
