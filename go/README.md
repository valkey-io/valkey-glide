)

func main() {
    host := "localhost"
    port := 6379

    config := config.NewClientConfiguration().
        WithAddress(&config.NodeAddress{Host: host, Port: port})

    client, err := glide.NewClient(config)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("There was an error: ", err)
        return
    }

    res, err := client.Ping(context.Background())
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("There was an error: ", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println(res) // PONG

    client.Close()
}
```

### Cluster Example:

)

func main() {
    host := "localhost"
    port := 7001

    config := config.NewClusterClientConfiguration().
        WithAddress(&config.NodeAddress{Host: host, Port: port})

    client, err := glide.NewClusterClient(config)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("There was an error: ", err)
        return
    }

    res, err := client.Ping(context.Background())
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("There was an error: ", err)
