# Valkey Glide Workflow Modularization

## Current Structure - Node.js Client

The Node.js implementation combines TypeScript code with native Rust modules, built and published as multiple packages:

- One pure TypeScript package (`@valkey/valkey-glide`)
- Multiple platform-specific packages with native code (`@valkey/valkey-glide-<platform>-<arch>`)

## Modular CI/CD Architecture

The Node.js CI/CD pipeline has been refactored into modular components for improved maintainability:

### 1. Component Workflows (in `.github/workflows/CD-NPM/`)

1. **`determine-version.yml`**: 
   - Detects version based on trigger (tag, PR, manual)
   - Sets npm tag (latest/next)

2. **`load-platform-matrix.yml`**: 
   - Filters build matrix entries for npm
   - Optimizes by removing redundant builds

3. **`build-binaries.yml`**: 
   - Builds native modules for each platform
   - Handles platform-specific requirements

4. **`organize-artifacts.yml`**: 
   - Organizes binaries into platform directories
   - Verifies package completeness

5. **`publish-platform-packages.yml`**: 
   - Publishes platform-specific packages
   - Handles idempotent publishing

6. **`publish-base-package.yml`**: 
   - Creates TypeScript-only package
   - Adds platform packages as dependencies

7. **`test-release.yml`**: 
   - Tests packages across platforms
   - Unpublishes on failure

### 2. Main Workflow (`.github/workflows/npm-cd.yml`)

The main workflow orchestrates these components with clear input/output dependencies:

```
determine-version → load-platform-matrix → build-binaries → organize-artifacts → 
publish-platform-packages → publish-base-package → test-release
```

### 3. Benefits of Modularization

- **Better maintainability**: Each component handles one concern
- **Improved debugging**: Easier to identify and fix issues
- **Enhanced reusability**: Components can be maintained separately
- **Clearer workflow**: Better visualization of the process

## Developer Documentation

The developer guide at `.github/workflows/CD-NPM/DEVELOPER.md` explains:
- Purpose of each component
- Input/output parameters
- Dependency flow between components
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Completed Work

1. **Created modular workflow components**
2. **Established input/output relationships**
3. **Added comprehensive developer documentation**
4. **Ensured proper error handling and reporting**
