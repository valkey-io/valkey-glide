3. [x] Create PubSubClusterChannelMode enum for cluster subscriptions
   - Define EXACT, PATTERN, and SHARDED modes
   - Add proper string representation
   - Ensure compatibility with Valkey's cluster subscription commands

4. [x] Implement BaseSubscriptionConfiguration interface
   - Define MessageCallback type
   - Create methods common to both standalone and cluster configurations
   - Implement context handling for callbacks

5. [x] Create StandaloneSubscriptionConfiguration

   - Define subscription management methods
   - Add proper documentation and examples

7. [x] Implement MessageHandler
   - Create PubSubMessageQueue for async message handling
   - Implement push message handling logic
   - Support for different push types (Message, PMessage, SMessage)

8. [x] Implement CallbackDispatcher
   - Add request registration and completion
   - Handle different error types
   - Implement graceful shutdown

9. [x] Update Glide client configurations to support subscriptions
   - Modify GlideClientConfiguration to accept subscription config
   - Modify GlideClusterClientConfiguration to accept cluster subscription config

10. [x] Add PubSub command methods to clients
    - Implement Subscribe, Publish, Unsubscribe methods
    - Implement PSubscribe, PPublish, PUnsubscribe methods
    - Implement SSubscribe, SPublish, SUnsubscribe methods for cluster mode

11. [x] Write unit tests for PubSub functionality
    - Test message creation and comparison
    - Test subscription configuration builders
    - Test callback and context handling

12. [x] Write integration tests for PubSub functionality
    - Test publishing and subscribing in standalone mode
    - Test publishing and subscribing in cluster mode
    - Test with different subscription modes

13. [x] Create examples for PubSub usage
    - Add example for standalone pubsub
    - Add example for cluster pubsub
    - Add example for using callbacks

14. [x] Update documentation
    - Update README with PubSub examples
    - Add GoDoc comments to all public APIs
    - Create developer documentation for extending PubSub functionality
